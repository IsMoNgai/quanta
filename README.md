PineScripts for Trading Algorithms and Chart UI

This repository contains Pine Script algorithms for trading strategies and a custom chart UI built using Lightweight Charts. The chart data is provided by the Interactive Brokers API (IBAPI), allowing for real-time market analysis. The scripts also include calculations for the slope of moving averages, enhancing technical analysis and strategy development on the TradingView platform.
